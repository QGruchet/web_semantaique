Stimulation of the FFH evoked ipsilateral mono- and disynaptic excitation, and contralateral disynaptic inhibition in trochlear motoneurons. Preconditioning stimulation of the ipsilateral SC facilitated FFH-evoked MSR excitation. Stimulation of the INC evoked ipsilateral MSR excitation and inhibition, and contralateral MSR inhibition in trochlear motoneurons. Preconditioning stimulation of the CL SC facilitated CL INC-evoked monosynaptic inhibition. These results revealed a reciprocal input pattern from the SCs to vertical ocular MNs.
