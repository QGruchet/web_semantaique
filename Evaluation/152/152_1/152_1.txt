The neural organization of the pathways from the superior colliculus (SC) to trochlear motoneurons was analyzed in anesthetized cats using intracellular recording and transneuronal labeling techniques. Stimulation of the ipsilateral or contralateral (CL) SC evoked excitation and inhibition in trochlear motoneurons, with latencies of [missing data] and [missing data] ms, respectively, suggesting that the earliest components of excitation and inhibition were disynaptic. A midline section between the two SCs revealed that ipsi- and contralateral SC stimulation evoked disynaptic excitation and inhibition in trochlear MNs, respectively. PM neurons labeled transneuronally (T3) after application of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase into the trochlear nerve were mainly distributed ipsilaterally in the Forel's field (h) (FFH) and bilaterally in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC). Consequently, we investigated these two likely intermediaries between the SC and trochlear nucleus electrophysiologically.
