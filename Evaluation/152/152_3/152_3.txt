In the SACN intermediates during DNA replication, however, the structure of these intermediates and their mechanism of the suppression are unknown. To examine this reaction, we have isolated and characterized a temperature-sensitive (ts) S2 of mus at the non-permissive temperature. sgsÎ”musts cells arrest at GM phase after going through S-phase. Bulk DNA replication appears CR but is defective since the rad checkpoint kinase is strongly phosphorylated under these conditions. In addition, the induction of rad hyperphosphorylation by MMS was deficient at PT.
