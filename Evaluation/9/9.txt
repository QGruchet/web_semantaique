In the present study, lithocholic acid (LCA) metabolism was assessed by radiochromatography and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and its relationship to cholestasis was investigated. In addition, the role of the perivenous zone in LCA-induced cholestasis and LCA biotransformation was examined by using BB, BZ, a chemical that c, and SP; eye movements are described. All drugs impaired both EM measures, but the doses used were not clinically equivalent. No available test is yet able to distinguish between benzodiazepines and neuroleptics.
